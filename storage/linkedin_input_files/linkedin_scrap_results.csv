How ironic it is when we are children our parents often tell us to not to talk to strangers. As parents we are suspicious with the people we don't know, and strangers are dangerous by default as we don't know exactly what their intentions are. Yet when we are adults, we see how important it is to talk and make connections with strangers, people we just meet in passing, not too familiar with, or don't even have any mutual connections.
 
Because we are hard wired for connections, it is important to remember we were all strangers once until we were not. I am glad to share this insightful talk of Kio Stark and embrace the profound benefits and beautiful moments of having genuine connections with strangers.
 
Yes, it may sound absurd to be connecting with total strangers. In making and building relationships, it should come first with a heart as it speaks volume of what the real intentions are and how we could be a great help and support to someone and brighten up the day.
 
At ELMO Software and Breathe Australia, we have teams that are so passionate and dedicated in meeting new people that it makes sense we champion the small businesses in the community through the #BigforSmall campaign. We know firsthand how hard it is to recover after months of lockdowns and reduced patronage that caused most of the small businesses to close and now, we are delighted to connect with them and be part of their bouncing back and help them regain strength for their reopening. We may not know all of the local business owners, but we want to help them get back to business too, just a total stranger making an impact on someone's life.

I am so delighted to share another story of a small business in Sydney CBD that, like us, has been challenged by the pandemic, lockdowns and border restrictions. 

Abbey's Bookshop is an iconic Australian-owned bookstore that was established in 1968. Allan Abbey shared that though they have some online presence, the bookstore generates most of its revenue from loyal customers who visit the store on their lunch breaks and spare time.

When the pandemic strikes and most of us have to stay at home, we have become accustomed to shop and make our purchases online and have chosen to read e-books rather than a physical book itself. Now that lockdowns have been lifted and small businesses are starting to reopen, we welcome you to visit Abbey's Bookshop and discover more exciting books for your next read.

There's a big difference and more to discover while shopping at a physical store than just sitting down in front of your computer and browsing the internet and shopping online. Way to go for #BigforSmall to bring life back to the city.

We would love your organisation to join us and get involved. Reach out for more information or visit www.bigforsmall.com.au
